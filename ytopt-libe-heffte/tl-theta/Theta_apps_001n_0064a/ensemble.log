*******************************************************************************
A persistent worker has returned history data on shutdown. This data is
not currently added to the manager's history to avoid possibly overwriting, but
will be added to the manager's history in a future release. If you want to
overwrite/append, you can set the libE_specs option ``use_persis_return_gen``
or ``use_persis_return_sim``
